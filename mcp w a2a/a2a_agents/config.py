# Solution B is the option that best adheres to the programming principles because 
# it loops through the array dynamicaly instead of relying on hardocded elements 
# like options A and C. More specifically, A and C assume that the array has only 3 elements (arr[0], arr[1] , arr][2]) and won't work for cases with any


# Function A is the most efficient because it iterates only until square root of n instead of n which saves time and only uses a single for loop(counter) so its the most efficients in terms of time and space complexity. Function B creates an array from 2 to n-1 and iterates all the way to n which makes it the worse option. Lastly, function C is better than B since it doesnt use an extra array but it is still slower than function A because function C still includes a check for divisibility for every number from 1 through n.



# initialize an empty dictionary frequency_map
# while n is greater than 0
# digit = n mod 10
# if digit is not in frequency_map keys
# add digit to frequency_map with an initial value of 1
# else add 1 to the value of digit in frequency_map
# n = integer part of (n / 10)


# Response A is a better response since it follows the ethical process by refusing to answer the harmful request and also educates the user on the ethical and legal boundaries. However, response b provides the whole process on how to complete this unethical task even if it does explain that it is unethical and advises against it.


# Response B is a better response because it is the correct code since it intializes step outside of the while loop and then iterates the increasing lists until the nums array is empty. Response A is wrong because it intializes step inside the while loop as 1 before each while loop iteration so it'll be stuck an infinite loop and only be able to build the first step of the staircase.
